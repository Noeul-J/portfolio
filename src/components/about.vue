            <p class="text-lg font-medium">I'm a developer who thrives at the intersection of logic and impact.</p>
            
            <p>With a strong foundation in automation and a deep interest in building scalable web applications, I take pride in solving real-world problems through clean and thoughtful code.</p>
            
            <p>My background includes years of experience in process automation (RPA) and backend development, where I've worked closely with cross-functional teams to streamline operations and build internal tools that matter.</p>
            
            <p>Recently, I've shifted my focus to frontend development using Vue.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, exploring how great UX and maintainable architecture go hand in hand.</p>

            <p>What excites me most is designing business logic that truly reflects a product's purpose â€” whether that means architecting a data pipeline, crafting a custom API, or translating a fuzzy requirement into something that actually works.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about learning, whether that's picking up a new language (currently improving my Japanese), exploring digital design, or studying cognitive science.</p>
